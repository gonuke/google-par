	abstract = {Minor actinides (MA) complicate repository design and are difficult to transmute in traditional reactors, but may be burned efficiently and safely using subcritically driven systems. A novel molten chloride MA-fueled subcritical MA burner driven by a fusion neutron source is presented; initial analysis demonstrates neutronic viability and potential positive impacts of long-term burnup. Subcritical system power is limited by the source strength, operating fission neutron multiplication (keff), and the efficient utilization of source neutrons. A novel definition for source utilization η is introduced as an effective predictor of power over a wide range of keff which enables a significant reduction in sensitivity to uncertainty in initial eigenvalue calculations and 2-3 orders of magnitude faster statistical convergence in fixed source calculations at keff=0.98. This facilitates efficient analysis and optimization of subcritical power in Monte Carlo based neutronics codes. Initial characteristics of the annular subcritical system are explored in OpenMC, and parametric studies evaluating η are performed leading to general geometric and material power scalings for subcritical systems. Through maximizing η, models achieve subcritical powers above 500 MWth and tritium production far above replacement with a compact mirror fusion device on the order of one megawatt with a source strength of 5×1017ns and a significantly subcritical blanket (keff=0.98). While these models and results do not account for all potential neutron losses, they demonstrate the potential of such systems to meaningfully burn MAs and provide value beyond power generation.},
