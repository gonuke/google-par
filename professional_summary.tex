\section{Professional Summary}

Wilson's research group began a project with local fusion startup Type One
Energy, supporting the neutronics evaluation of different blanket concepts. This
work also created an opportunity to recruit two students pursuing a non-research
masters programs as a pilot for training engineers from different backgrounds
for careers in fusion technology.

As department chair, the final phases of departmental restructuring occurred in
2023, with courses and degree programs moving to the Mechanical Engineering
department, and the department name formally changing to "Nuclear Engineering \&
Engineering Physics".
