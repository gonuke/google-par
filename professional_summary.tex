\section{Professional Summary}

This was a challenging year for the NEEP department, in general, as for me 
as chair, in specific.  We began the year with two of our senior faculty 
on sabbatical/leave and just as they were returning, two other senior faculty
left for retirement.  Throughout this time, another senior faculty member 
was serving an important role in the Dean's office. Thus we relied on 2-3 
tenured faculty to carry the service needs of the department.

With that backdrop, this was also a year with an oversized service burden,
most notably an ABET self-study for the BS Nuclear Engineering program and three
tenure cases (25\% of the department). With the retirement of Carl Sovinec and
Wendy Crone, we lost a substantial amount of service capacity, in general, and
most of our experience with the BS Engineering Physics program, in specific.
During this year, we also recruited our largest ever class of incoming nuclear
engineering undergraduates and one of our largest ever class of incoming PhD
students.

Throughout that period, I contributed to 10 multi-million dollar
multi-institution proposals with NNSA, ARPA-E CHADWICK and REDUCE programs, and
the OFES FIRE program, while overseeing a research group of about 12 graduate
students.
