\section{Professional Summary}

Paul Wilson's first year as chair of the Department of Engineering Physics
coincided with the launch of two large consortia funded by NNSA.  He is serving
as a thrust area lead in the Enabling Technology and Innovation consortium based
at Georgia Tech, and as the Nuclear Policy cross-cutting lead for the Monitoring
Technology and Verification consortium based at the University of Michigan. This
marks a substantial shift of his fuel cycle research into the non-proliferation
space, with a focus on higher fidelity facility modeling and data science
approaches.  He continues to expand the reach of the DAGMC software with a first
users and developers meeting including scientists from national labs, startups
and other universities. 

In addition to being a member of its Board of Directors, Wilson's also became
the chair of the Fusion Energy Division of the American Nuclear Society.  With
that role, he has an opportunity to participate as an ex-officio member of the
Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee at an important time when they are
compiling the fusion community's interests into a strategic plan for the Office
of Fusion Energy Sciences.
