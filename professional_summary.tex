\section{Professional Summary}

Wilson and his research group saw their first foray into modern machine
learning, with student Jordan Stomps introducing contrastive learning based
on artificial neural networks to categorize specific radiation spectrum
features as associated with specific movements of radioactive material.

Wilson, as department chair, successfully oversaw the restructuring of the
department over the course of 2022. Following a number of faculty discussions,
the Engineering Mechanics faculty voted to transfer their tenure homes to the
Department of Mechanical Engineering, and bring the related academic programs
with them. To implement this change required a carefully planned array of
stakeholder engagements and administrative actions. The faculty tenure home
transition was completed at the beginning of 2023, and the academic program
changes continued in the following Spring semester.

Wilson also began his term as the Chair of the Nuclear Engineering Department
Head Organization (NEDHO).
