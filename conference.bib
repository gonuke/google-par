	abstract = {The IAEA considers a Stateâ€™s entire fuel cycle capability when evaluating and implementing safeguards, a process known as the State-Level Approach. Conducting Acquisition Path Analysis (APA) is one aspect of ensuring efficient use of safeguards resources and an objective evaluation of member States. APA is designed to identify, characterize, and rank technically-feasible pathways through a fuel cycle to produce weapons-usable material. This paper covers the integration of APA techniques into the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. Material flowing through a nuclear fuel cycle can be represented by a directed graph (digraph) with vertices V(D) repre-
senting facilities and edges E(D) representing trade or material transport. In a Cyclus input file, a user defines a set of facility prototypes and the commodities that can be traded between them.
From this user-specified fuel cycle, a digraph is generated representing all possible commodity trades between facilities. Graph traversal techniques are used to enumerate all pathways for
material to flow through the given fuel cycle. Pathways that produce weapons-usable material are filtered and further analyzed. Due to the flexibility of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator, this
method works for any fuel cycle, including ones that use closed facility models that are not part of the open source Cyclus and Cycamore facility libraries.},

	title = {Evaluation of {Critical} {Experiments} in the {University} of {Wisconsin} {Nuclear} {Reactor} ({UWNR}) with {Uncertainty} {Quantification}},
	isbn = {978-1-5272-6447-2},
	abstract = {An improved computational model for the University of Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor (UWNR) has been developed to facilitate automated input generation, data provenance, and modularity for alternate representations. This development was initiated as part of efforts to evaluate recent data acquired during an experimental campaign conducted at UWNR to generate benchmark data for validation. Specifically, this evaluation effort aims to contribute a number of fresh and depleted critical (CRIT) configurations of UWNR as well as steady-state and transient reaction-rate (RRATE) measurements. Previous efforts led to a scripted UWNR model that supports automated generation of inputs for MCNP and Serpent. Recently, this capability was extended to SCALE/KENO, which required significant changes to the underlying geometry and material representations. All three Monte Carlo tools (MCNP, Serpent, and KENO) are being used to evaluate a variety of zero-power, fresh-critical configuration and will be used to model burnup for evaluation of depleted-critical configurations. The inclusion of SCALE/KENO input generation makes possible a variety of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses using the TSUNAMI and SAMPLER modules of SCALE. In addition, an automated mesh-generation option was added based on the UW-developed, MCNP-to-CAD plugin. As a result, a meshed geometry for use with deterministic tools (e.g., MAMMOTH/Rattlesnake) can be produced that is fully consistent with the Monte Carlo models. Work is ongoing to develop a full core model in MAMMOTH/Rattlesnake, which is a deterministic code based on the MOOSE framework. This model will be used for the evaluation of several transient experiments conducted at UWNR. Preliminary results of fresh-critical configurations show a good agreement among the four codes and experimental data. Also, preliminary results of depleted-critical configurations indicate that the depleted core model successfully tracks core reactivity over time as long as an initial (but relatively small) reactivity bias is eliminated. Formal uncertainty quantification will be carried out using SCALE to study the impact of model uncertainties on the effective multiplication factor and other observables. In conclusion, the evaluation of UWNR benchmark data provides increased confidence in various states/configurations of the UWNR computational model and will provide a unique model for use by other analysts.},
