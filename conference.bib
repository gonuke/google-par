	abstract = {Cardinal is a multiphysics software tool that couples OpenMC Monte Carlo transport and NekRS Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). This work verifies Cardinal for coupled neutron transport and heat conduction using a 1-D analytical solution from previous work by the Naval Nuclear Laboratory. This numerical benchmark includes S2 transport, Doppler-broadened cross sections, thermal conduction and expansion, and convective boundary conditions. The goal of this work is to verify Cardi-nal's basic multiphysics modeling capabilities for coupled neutronics and heat conduction. The benchmark provides analytical solutions for the temperature and flux distributions, as well as the k-eigenvalue. Using these solutions, an L2 error norm was computed for each spatial discretiza-tion: namely finite element heat conduction mesh and Monte Carlo cells. The temperature error showed linear convergence on a log-log plot of error vs. mesh element number, with a slope of −0.9986 (R{\textasciicircum}2 ≈ 1.0). Nearly all spatial flux predictions, except a few points in the N = 250 case, space were within 2σ of the analytical solution, for Monte Carlo cell counts between 50 and 1000. The eigenvalue k eff also agrees well with the benchmark value for each mesh size. The outcome of this work is verification of coupled Monte Carlo-thermal conduction modeling using Cardinal.},
