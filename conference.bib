	abstract = {CAD-based Monte Carlo radtiaion transport is of value to the nuclear engineering community for its ability to conduct transport on high fidelity models of nuclear systems, but it is more computationally expensive than native geometry representations. This work describes the adaptation of a rendering data structure, the signed distance field, as a geometric query tool for accelerating CAD-based transport in the Direct Accelerated Monte Carlo (DAGMC) toolkit. Demonstrations of its effectiveness are shown for a number of problems. The beginnings of a predictive model for the data structure's utilization based on various problem parameters is also introduced.},
