	abstract = {Progress in simulation of shutdown dose rates in fusion energy systems has seen substantial advances in recent years, motivated largely by the urgent and immediate regulatory needs of ITER.  A variety of approaches have been developed to increase the fidelity, accuracy and/or performance of these simulations, including the D1S approach and multiple implementations of R2S approaches that incorporate different mesh schemes, material homogenization approximations, and photon source sampling algorithms. All of these solutions are based, in some way, on the transmutation operator that determines the photon source from the neutron flux spectrum at each location in space.  The non-linearity of this operator has frequently been an obstacle in formulating efficient solutions, but recent analysis has found that linear approximations to this operator can be adequate for many purposes.  This paper will review the recent improvements in shutdown dose rate capability and explore some next steps that all depend on this linearization.  Specifically, this linearization has recently enabled improvements in D1S methods and variance reduction schemes for R2S methods.  This same linearization can also be used to improve estimates of statistical error propagated from stochastic neutron transport to stochastic photon transport and enables variance reduction in shutdown dose rate problems with moving components.
One elusive addition to R2S shutdown dose rate analysis has been the estimation of the statistical error as it propagates from the stochastic neutron transport step through the transmutation operator and into the photon source and subsequent stochastic transport.  A number of efforts have attempted to understand this problem mathematically and implement solutions. The linearization of the transmutation operator provides a useful addition here, providing a reasonable approximation for assessing the statistical error in the photon source due to the stochastically generated neutron flux.
Finally, estimating cumulative dose rates integrated over maintenance procedures in which some radioactive components are transported through the system requires multiple photon source problems add computational burden.  In particular, the standard GT-CADIS methodology no long provides accurate variance reduction parameters as the photon production in different locations will be important at different points in time.  An extension of GT-CADIS is has been developed to identify variance reduction parameters for neutron transport that track the movement of those components over time.},
