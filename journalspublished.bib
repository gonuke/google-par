	abstract = {This study surveyed 137 policymakers and key stakeholders (e.g., employees of government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, industry, and advocacy groups) involved in making decisions on nuclear energy policy, investigating how they differentially perceived the importance of scientific evidence in driving nuclear policy. We also identified the policy areas that each group of decision-makers are mostly concerned about and showed how such concerns might contextualize and ultimately shape their perceptions of science-driven policy.},

	abstract = {Neutronics analysis was performed on the latest Fusion Energy System Studies-Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FESS-FNSF) design, which determined the neutron wall loading, tritium breeding ratio, and radiation damage. Sixteen different sectors configurations were investigated, with the main focus on determining the impact which each has upon the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of the whole facility. This paper describes the stages of the nuclear analysis that serve to prove the radiation derived attributes of the system.},

	abstract = {Information visualization could be used to leverage the credibility of displayed scientific data. However, little was known about how display characteristics interact with individuals' predispositions to affect perception of data credibility. Using an experiment with 517 participants, we tested perceptions of data credibility by manipulating data visualizations related to the issue of nuclear fuel cycle based on three characteristics: graph format, graph interactivity, and source attribution. Results showed that viewers tend to rely on preexisting levels of trust and peripheral cues, such as source attribution, to judge the credibility of shown data, whereas their comprehension level did not relate to perception of data credibility. We discussed the implications for science communicators and design professionals.},

In this paper, the development and validation of FluDAG is discussed and its application to a number of high energy physics experiments is demonstrated, along with its validity relative to native FLUKA calculations.},
