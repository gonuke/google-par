	abstract = {PyNE R2S is a mesh-based R2S implementation with the capability of performing shutdown dose rate (SDR) analysis directly on CAD geometry with Cartesian or tetrahedral meshes. It supports advanced variance reduction for fusion energy systems. However, the assumption of homogenized materials of PyNE R2S with a Cartesian mesh throughout a mesh voxel introduces an approximation in the case where a voxel covers multiple non-void cells. This work implements a sub-voxel method to add fidelity to PyNE R2S with a Cartesian mesh during the process of activation and photon source sampling by performing independent inventory calculations for each cell within a mesh voxel and using the results of those independent calculations to sample the photon source more precisely. PyNE sub-voxel R2S has been verified with the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG)-ITER and ITER computational shutdown dose rate benchmark problems. The results for sub-voxel R2S show satisfactory agreement with the experimental values or reference results. PyNE sub-voxel R2S has been applied to the shutdown dose rate calculation of the Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor (CFETR). In conclusion, sub-voxel R2S is a reliable tool for SDR calculation and obtains more accurate results with the same voxel size than voxel R2S.},

	abstract = {In fusion energy systems, part of the design effort is dedicated to the assessment of the shutdown dose rate (SDR) due to the decay photons that will be emitted from activated components. Monte Carlo transport codes are often used to obtain the neutron flux distribution in the problem domain. The neutron flux distribution is used in the rigorous 2-step (R2S) workflow to obtain the photon emission density distribution of decaying radionuclides. The photon emission density is then used as an input for a dedicated photon transport step to calculate the SDR. In this paper, the uncertainty of the decay gamma source due to the uncertainty of the neutron flux distribution in the R2S workflow is investigated. A scheme is developed to estimate the uncertainty of the decay gamma source, building on the concept of groupwise transmutation and using standard error propagation techniques. The applicability of the newly developed scheme is then demonstrated on one of the conceptual designs of the fusion nuclear science facility.},
