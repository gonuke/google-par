	abstract = {The three-dimensional variation inherent to stellarator geometries and fusion sources motivates three-dimensional modeling to obtain accurate results from computational modeling in support of design and analysis of first wall, blanket, and shield (FWBS) systems. Manually constructing stellarator fusion power plant geometries in computer-aided design (CAD) and defining the corresponding fusion source can be cumbersome and challenging. The open-source parametric modeling toolset ParaStell has been developed to automate construction of such geometries in low-fidelity. Low-fidelity modeling is useful during the conceptual phase of engineering design as a means of rapidly exploring the design space of a given device. The modeling capability of ParaStell includes in-vessel components and magnets, for any given stellarator configuration, using a parametric definition and plasma equilibrium data. Furthermore, the toolset automates the generation of detailed, tetrahedral neutron source definitions and DAGMC geometries for use in neutronics modeling. ParaStell assists rapid design iteration, parametric study, and design optimization of stellarator fusion cores. As a demonstration of the design iteration capability, the effect of the three-dimensional parameter space on tritium breeding and magnet shielding is investigated, using the WISTELL-D configuration as a design basis. Blanket and shield thicknesses are varied in three dimensions, using the space available between the plasma edge and magnet coils as a constraint. The corresponding effects on tritium breeding ratio and magnet heating are tallied using the open-source Monte Carlo particle transport code OpenMC. The inclusion of additional and higher-fidelity modeling capabilities is planned for ParaStell's future, as well as its implementation in machine-driven optimization.},

	abstract = {Data analysis techniques can be powerful tools for rapidly analyzing data and extracting information that can be used in a latent space for categorizing observations between classes of data. Machine learning models that exploit learned data relationships can address a variety of nuclear nonproliferation challenges like the detection and tracking of shielded radiological material transfers. The high resource cost of manually labeling radiation spectra is a hindrance to the rapid analysis of data collected from persistent monitoring and to the adoption of supervised machine learning methods that require large volumes of curated training data. Instead, contrastive self-supervised learning on unlabeled spectra can enhance models that are built on limited labeled radiation datasets. This work demonstrates that contrastive machine learning is an effective technique for leveraging unlabeled data in detecting and characterizing nuclear material transfers demonstrated on radiation measurements collected at an Oak Ridge National Laboratory testbed, where sodium iodide detectors measure gamma radiation emitted by material transfers between the High Flux Isotope Reactor and the Radiochemical Engineering Development Center. Label-invariant data augmentations tailored for gamma radiation detection physics are used on unlabeled spectra to contrastively train an encoder, learning a complex, embedded state space with self-supervision. A linear classifier is then trained on a limited set of labeled data to distinguish transfer spectra between byproducts and tracked nuclear material using representations from the contrastively trained encoder. The optimized hyperparameter model achieves a balanced accuracy score of 80.30\%. Any given model—that is, a trained encoder and classifier—shows preferential treatment for specific subclasses of transfer types. Regardless of the classifier complexity, a supervised classifier using contrastively trained representations achieves higher accuracy than using spectra when trained and tested on limited labeled data.},
