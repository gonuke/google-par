	abstract = {The selection, design, and optimization of a suitable blanket configuration for an advanced high-field stellarator concept is seen as a key feasibility issue and has been incorporated as a vital and necessary part of the Infinity Two Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) physics basis. The focus of this work was to identify a baseline blanket which can be rapidly deployed for Infinity Two while also maintaining flexibility and opportunities for higher performing concepts later in development. Results from this analysis indicate that gas-cooled solid breeder designs such as the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) are the most promising concepts, primarily motivated by the neutronics performance at applicable blanket build depths, and the relatively mature technology basis. The lithium lead (PbLi) family of concepts, particularly the Dual Cooled Lithium Lead (DCLL), offer a compelling alternative to solid blanket concepts as they have synergistic developmental pathways while simultaneously mitigating much of the technical risk of those designs. Homogenized 3-dimensional neutronics analysis of the Infinity Two configuration indicates that the HCPB achieves an adequate tritium breeding ratio (TBR) (1.30 which enables sufficient margin at low engineering fidelity), and near appropriate shielding of the magnets (average fast fluence of 1.3 x 1018 n/cm2 per fullpower year). The thermal analysis indicates that reasonably high thermal efficiencies (greater than 30\%) are readily achievable with the HCPB paired with a simple Rankine cycle using reheat. Finally, the tritium fuel cycle analysis for Infinity Two shows viability, with anticipated operational inventories of less than one kilogram (approximately 675 grams) and a required TBR (TBRreq) of less than 1.05 to maintain fuel self-sufficiency (approximately 1.023 for a driver blanket with no inventory doubling). Although further optimization and engineering design is still required, at the physics basis stage all initial targets have been met for the Infinity Two configuration.},

	abstract = {We provide an assessment of the Infinity Two fusion pilot plant (FPP) baseline plasma physics design. Infinity Two is a four-field period, aspect ratio 𝐴=10A=10A = 10, quasi-isodynamic stellarator with improved confinement appealing to a max-𝐽JJ approach, elevated plasma density and high magnetic fields (⟨𝐵⟩=9⟨B⟩=9 {\textbackslash}langle B{\textbackslash}rangle = 9 T). Here 𝐽JJ denotes the second adiabatic invariant. At the envisioned operating point (800800800 MW deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion), the configuration has robust magnetic surfaces based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium calculations and is stable to both local and global MHD instabilities. The configuration has excellent confinement properties with small neoclassical transport and low bootstrap current ({\textbar}𝐼𝑏𝑜𝑜𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑝{\textbar}∼2{\textbar}Ibootstrap{\textbar}∼2{\textbar}I\_\{bootstrap\}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}sim 2 kA). Calculations of collisional alpha-particle confinement in a DT FPP scenario show small energy losses to the first wall ({\textless}1.5\%{\textless}1.5\%\{{\textbackslash}lt\}1.5 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%) and stable energetic particle/Alfvén eigenmodes at high ion density. Low turbulent transport is produced using a combination of density profile control consistent with pellet fueling and reduced stiffness to turbulent transport via three-dimensional shaping. Transport simulations with the T3D-GX-SFINCS code suite with self-consistent turbulent and neoclassical transport predict that the DT fusion power𝑃𝑓𝑢𝑠=800Pfus=800P\_\{\{fus\}\}=800 MW operating point is attainable with high fusion gain (𝑄=40Q=40Q=40) at volume-averaged electron densities 𝑛𝑒≈2×1020ne≈2×1020n\_e{\textbackslash}approx 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{20\} m−3−3{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, below the Sudo density limit. Additional transport calculations show that an ignited (𝑄=∞Q=∞Q={\textbackslash}infty) solution is available at slightly higher density (2.2×10202.2×10202.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{20\} m−3−3{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}) with 𝑃𝑓𝑢𝑠=1.5Pfus=1.5P\_\{\{fus\}\}=1.5 GW. The magnetic configuration is defined by a magnetic coil set with sufficient room for an island divertor, shielding and blanket solutions with tritium breeding ratios (TBR) above unity. An optimistic estimate for the gas-cooled solid breeder designed helium-cooled pebble bed is TBR ∼1.3∼1.3{\textbackslash}sim 1.3. Infinity Two satisfies the physics requirements of a stellarator fusion pilot plant.},
