	abstract = {In fusion energy systems, part of the design effort is dedicated to the assessment of the shutdown dose rate (SDR) due to the decay photons that will be emitted from activated components. Monte Carlo transport codes are often used to obtain the neutron flux distribution in the problem domain. The neutron flux distribution is used in the rigorous 2-step (R2S) workflow to obtain the photon emission density distribution of decaying radionuclides. The photon emission density is then used as an input for a dedicated photon transport step to calculate the SDR. In this paper, the uncertainty of the decay gamma source due to the uncertainty of the neutron flux distribution in the R2S workflow is investigated. A scheme is developed to estimate the uncertainty of the decay gamma source, building on the concept of groupwise transmutation and using standard error propagation techniques. The applicability of the newly developed scheme is then demonstrated on one of the conceptual designs of the fusion nuclear science facility.},

	abstract = {A feasibility study of a subcritical fission-fusion hybrid reactor using lead-lithium eutectic as a coolant and minor actinides (MAs) as fuel is presented. Such a reactor could support the fission community by transmuting MAs and the fusion community by breeding tritium. The feasibility of such a reactor for the burnup of MAs is assessed in terms of burnup performance, tritium breeding, and safety characteristics. Tandem mirrors are a promising neutron source technology, and a deuterium-tritium tandem mirror is considered here for the neutron source with power Psource = 1.13 MW assumed for scoping purposes. Subcritical reactivities from keff = 0.9800 to keff = 0.9950 were considered, representing the initial reference for subcritical reactivity and the assessed upper limit, respectively. Stability analyses indicated the reactivity would be stable under perturbations of fuel, coolant, and inlet temperatures, with a positive reactivity insertion expected during reactor shutdown. This keff range corresponded to nuclear heating values of 150 to 650 MW and mass burn rates of 53 to 216 kg/year. The upper mass burn rate limit would require 1110 reactor years with a capacity factor of 0.9 to fission the global supply of MAs and could offset the annual U.S. MA production with eight reactors. Tritium breeding was assessed for keff = 0.9800 and 3.795\% 6Li enrichment in the coolant, and a tritium breeding ratio of 1.602 ± 0.017 was tallied, suggesting the reactor could, without elevated 6Li enrichment, produce tritium to both sustain operation and supply tritium for other fusion devices. Time-series modeling of fuel burnup was conducted for a four-batch loading scheme and three different fuel residence times at keff = 0.9800, which showed system performance would drop with burnup, and that the rate of this drop was lower for longer fuel residence times, motivating a means of reactivity control. Last, changes in fuel composition with burnup were assessed for relative concentrations of MAs, transmutation products, and fission products. The breeding of plutonium in the blanket was calculated and found to be of minimal proliferation concern.},

	abstract = {The timely detection of special nuclear material (SNM) transfers between nuclear facilities is an important monitoring objective in nuclear nonproliferation. Persistent monitoring enabled by successful detection and characterization of radiological material movements could greatly enhance the nuclear nonproliferation mission in a range of applications. Supervised machine learning can be used to signal detections when material is present if a model is trained on sufficient volumes of labeled measurements. However, the nuclear monitoring data needed to train robust machine learning models can be costly to label since radiation spectra may require strict scrutiny for characterization. Therefore, this work investigates the application of semi-supervised learning to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. As a demonstration experiment, radiation measurements from sodium iodide (NaI) detectors are provided by the Multi-Informatics for Nuclear Operating Scenarios (MINOS) venture at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as sample data. Anomalous measurements are identified using a method of statistical hypothesis testing. After background estimation, an energy-dependent spectroscopic analysis is used to characterize an anomaly based on its radiation signatures. In the absence of ground-truth information, a labeling heuristic provides data necessary for training and testing machine learning models. Supervised logistic regression serves as a baseline to compare three semi-supervised machine learning models: co-training, label propagation, and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In each case, the semi-supervised models outperform logistic regression, suggesting that unlabeled data can be valuable when training and demonstrating value in semi-supervised nonproliferation implementations.},

	abstract = {In accelerator-driven systems, charged particles and high-energy neutrons can contribute to the production of nuclides that can persist long after the system has been shut down. These nuclides release photons that contribute to the biological dose. It is essential to quantify the biological dose as a function of time after shutdown to ensure safe working conditions for laborers during maintenance procedures. The shutdown dose rate (SDR) can be calculated with the Rigorous Two-Step (R2S) method, which includes a neutron and photon transport coupled with an activation calculation. For accelerator-driven systems, calculating SDR presents challenges related to the neutron cross-sectional data available for high-energy neutrons. A tally was implemented to collect isotope production data directly in a Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) calculation. The output of this RNUCS tally is then used directly in an activation calculation, bypassing the need to use cross-section data with the neutron flux to obtain the isotope production and destruction data. A mesh-based RNUCS-R2S workflow has been developed based on this tally to calculate SDR in accelerator-driven systems. This workflow operates directly on computer-aided design geometry and supports using a meshed photon source. This workflow has been verified against a cell-based RNUCS-R2S workflow. A test problem with the essential characteristics of an accelerator-driven system was created to use in this analysis. The SDR results are within 40\% of the cell-based RNUCS-R2S results. The workflow was also validated with the spallation neutron source system. Most detectors’ SDR results are within 50\%, with a few detectors having a significantly lower SDR result than the experimental value.},
