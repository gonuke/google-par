This was a challenging year, particularly the Fall semester, with confluence of:
\begin{itemize}
\item losing an important scientist and a CAD engineer, while
\item carrying 12 PhD students,
\item teaching $>$2 courses, and
\item investing substantial time in strategic planning.
\end{itemize}

A variety of software maintenance, enhancement and improvement tasks were
completed by my group that generally do not get published in a traditional
manner.  This year, there was a major refactor of the DAGMC software,
embedding some routines more firmly in the core of the MOAB library upon which
it depends, and separating the metadata portions into a different library.
Patrick Shriwise in my group was also responsible for creating a highly
functional Python interface to the MOAB core, replacing the long-deprecated
PyTAPS interface.
