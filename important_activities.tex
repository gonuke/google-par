As the first chair of the College of Engineering Promotions and Tenure
Committee, I needed to establish policies and procedures for completing fair
reviews of Third Year reviews of assistant professors, tenure cases and
promotions to full professor.  All of this was completed in the spirit of
continuous improvement for departments, rather than simply providing an extra
hurdle for departments.  In addition to developing a streamlined approach for
performing these reviews, the committee compiled information about mentoring
policies in each department.
